# LunarLander
A simulation environment for lunar lander using SFML, Box-2D in C++

Experiment.cpp File contains the basic structure for visualzing the lunar lander environment.

Experiment2.cpp File contains the structure + physics simulating the free fall.

Experiment3.cpp File contains the structure + physics + collision errors simulating the free fall

Experiment4.cpp File cotains all of the baove structure plus includes ground work for integrating RL algorithms
